# Purpose for this repository

## Why I Created This

This is my personal learning repository for understanding and practicing reverse shell connections using NetCat. I created this as a reference guide for myself while studying cybersecurity and penetration testing techniques in my home lab environment.

## What I Want to Learn

Through this repository, I aim to master:

1. **Understanding TCP Connections**: How the communication actually works between my attacking VM (Kali) and victim VM (Ubuntu)
2. **NetCat Mastery**: Getting comfortable with nc commands and all their parameters
3. **File Transfer Skills**: Learning different ways to move files between compromised systems
4. **Command Execution**: Understanding how to run commands remotely through established connections

## My Lab Setup

I'm practicing these techniques on:
- **Kali Linux VM** (Attacker machine)
- **Ubuntu VM** (Victim machine) 
- **Isolated network environment** for safe testing

## Important Reminders for Myself

**NEVER use these techniques on systems I don't own!**

This is strictly for:
- My personal lab environment
- Learning and skill development
- Understanding how these attacks work
- Preparing for ethical hacking certifications

## What This Repository Contains

My notes and commands for:
- Setting up NetCat listeners
- Creating reverse shell connections
- Transferring files between VMs
- Basic troubleshooting when connections fail

## Personal Learning Goals

- Get comfortable with command line networking
- Understand what each parameter does in the commands
- Practice until I can set up these connections quickly
- Document any issues I encounter and their solutions

This is my learning journey - keeping it simple, practical, and focused on hands-on practice in my controlled environment.
